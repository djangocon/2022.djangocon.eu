        <meta name="title" content="From React to htmx on a real-world SaaS product: we did it, and it&#x27;s awesome!  - DjangoCon Europe 2022 pretalx">
        <meta name="description" content="üîç You‚Äôve probably heard of **[htmx](https://htmx.org)**, maybe seen talks about it (maybe even [right here last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs0DXR1S03M)). Demos are great, potential seems enormous. Maybe you&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s great for quick prototyping and tried it.

‚ùì But what about switching for your real-life project, against everything you‚Äôve heard since 2016 (‚Äù*modern web interfaces need Javascript-driven webapps*‚Äù, &quot;*the best SaaS products are made of an SPA*&quot;, etc.)? Does htmx keep its promises? What impact on your product, your team, your business?

‚úÖ That&#x27;s what we just did at **[Contexte](https://www.contexte.com/)**, by getting rid of the React SPA of a SaaS product. It wasn&#x27;t a easy decision to make (because the UI holds some fairly complex interactions and we were told such interactions require client-side state management), but it&#x27;s now such a relief. Maybe if we share our experience the decision would be easier to make for others.

üí¨ Draft outline of the talk:

- **What is Contexte**? mainly about our Product/Tech team size and organization
- **What is our first SaaS product, Contexte Scan** (click [here](https://essai-contexte-com.translate.goog/scan?_x_tr_sl=fr&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=fr&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp) for a Google-translated product presentation)? a quick demo, with an emphasis on the most complex UI elements (I&#x27;m not here to sell it to you üòâ )
- **Our React UI**: bulky, buggy, constantly refactored, dependency hell (quick tour, some figures)
- **Our htmx UI**: a bit of code here, with examples of how you replace client-side state management with just some htmx-loaded HTML fragments
- **Impact on end-users**: same UX, better performances
- **Impact on the team**: faster, fullstack, more agile
- **Impact on the planet**: smaller footprint on end-users computers
- **Conclusion**: go for it!
