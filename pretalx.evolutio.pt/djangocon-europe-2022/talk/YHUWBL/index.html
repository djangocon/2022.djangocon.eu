        <meta name="description" content="Django doesn&#x27;t have many opinions about front-end development. This is a blessing and a curse -- it means a lot of freedom for projects to approach UIs however they see fit, but also a lot of choices to make on each and every project. It also means the Django ecosystem is lagging far behind more modern platforms.

It doesn&#x27;t have to be this way. The team behind the Wagtail CMS spent a lot of time refining how they approach UI development in the context of Django projects, and we&#x27;ll now get to learn from their experience.

We started with workflows that work well with React: components are first-class citizens, and tools like Storybook playing to those strengths. We then adapted this for Django, building a full-fledged design system and making the most of automation to test our user interface.

In this talk we&#x27;ll cover,

-   Component-driven development as a methodology
-   Tools we used and created to apply those concepts to Django codebases
-   Demo time! How we use those tools to build our CMS, Wagtail
-   How we envision the Django ecosystem evolving

This should generally be a beginner-level talk for Django developers. Developers who are mostly focused on back-end work will learn about modern front-end methodologies. We will make some references to popular JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue), but no prior knowledge with those will be required.
