Not up for a full talk or tutorial? Looking to give your first talk at a conference? Lightning talks are talks of 5 minutes or less, with or without slides, on almost any topic you want! Even if you’re nervous or shy, remember: it’s a MAXIMUM of 5 minutes. Everyday of the conference will feature a lightning talk slot at the end of the day. Sign-ups will happen **prior to the conference**.

To participate just record your 5 min lightning ⚡talk, and submit it in this [form](https://forms.gle/1uJbLhtwYfgLqHvz9){:target="_blank"}!
