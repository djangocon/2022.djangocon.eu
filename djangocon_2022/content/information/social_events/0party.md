The party venue is [Embaixada do Porto](https://goo.gl/maps/KP2wdvfo8BDca4vQ8){:target="_blank"}. The entrance will be **completely free** for all participants, and there is a **drink included** 🍻 at the private DjangoCon Europe 2022 party 🍾 With the offer of a free party with one drink, we are hoping to make it inclusive for everyone to participate in the social part of the conference without the cost being an issue. **Join Us!** 🥳
